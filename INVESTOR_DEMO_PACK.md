## üé¨ Demo Script

**Introduction (30s):**
```
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], founder of Converto‚Ñ¢.

We've built Finland's first self-learning business automation platform.

Let me show you how it works..."
```

**Product Demo (5min):**
```
[Screen share: app.converto.fi]

"Here's our dashboard. Notice the status indicators at the top.

[Point to chips]
This shows we're using OpenAI for AI, with 112ms latency.

But watch this - I can switch to local Ollama with one click.

[Show provider switch]

Now all processing happens locally - no data leaves Finland.

Let me scan a receipt...

[Upload receipt]

AI extracts everything automatically. If I correct something...

[Click thumbs down, edit]

The system learns and won't make that mistake again.

This is what we call Self-Learning Intelligence."
```

"Here's why this matters:

For a company processing 1000 receipts/month,
this pays for itself in the first month."

## üìä Investor FAQ

### **Q: Why not just use OpenAI?**

**A:** "We do support OpenAI, but we also give customers the option
to run 100% locally with Ollama. This saves 90% on AI costs and
ensures GDPR compliance. It's a competitive advantage."

### **Q: What if OpenAI changes pricing?**

**A:** "We're provider-agnostic. Customers can switch to Ollama
or Anthropic with one environment variable. No vendor lock-in."

### **Q: How do you compete with Procountor?**

**A:** "Procountor is ‚Ç¨50-200/month and cloud-only. We're ‚Ç¨29-199/month
with a local option. We target security-conscious SMEs who want
data sovereignty."

### **Q: What's your moat?**

**A:** "Three things:
1. Self-learning ML (gets smarter over time)
2. Provider-agnostic architecture (no lock-in)
3. 100% local option (unique in Finland)"

### **Q: When will you be profitable?**

**A:** "With ‚Ç¨100k funding, we reach break-even at 600 customers
in month 12. That's ‚Ç¨18k MRR at ‚Ç¨30 ARPU."
